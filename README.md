# social-distancing
As social distancing is very important to reduce the spread of the virus. To implement this the shops in close vicinity should not remain open all at the same time as social distancing will not be effective. To manage this problem we will make a software which take number of shops as input and result will be the schedule of week about the timing of different shops to be open at particular time of day. This schedule will be decided such that no two consecutive shops be open at the same particular time.
